  <p>There are alternatives to energy sources that affect the environment. <br> <br> There are many sustainable energy sources that do not harm the environment. One of these sources is solar energy. Though a little pricy, it doesn not harm the environment much. Solar energy technologies convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic (PV) panels or through mirrors that concentrate solar radiation. <br> <br>Another energy source that's good for the environment is hydroelectric power. It's the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines. This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power. <br> <br> Wind energy is the use of wind turbines (wind mills) to generate electricity. Wind power is a popular, sustainable, renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels. </p>
